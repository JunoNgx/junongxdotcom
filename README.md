# Portfolio Website

My centralised portfolio website, where my works across fields and medium gather in one single place.

## Current deployment

The website is currently deployed at [JunoNgx.com](https://junongx.com/) via Netlify.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/ff83aa39-9847-428e-ad7e-f63cb7fe6883/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/junongxdotcom/deploys)

## Tech stack

This project is made with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) (using BEM naming convention), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Environment variables

This project doesn't require any environment variable and no setup is neccessary for deployment.

## Local deployment

First, clone the repository and move into the directory:

```
git clone git@github.com:JunoNgx/junongxdotcom.git
cd junongxdotcom

Then, run the development server:

```bash

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) with your browser to see the result.

This is a self-contained static site and doesn't require any data fetching.
