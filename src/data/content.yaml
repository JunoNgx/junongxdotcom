    I am a hobbyist gamedev and make an awful lot of videogames just for the sheer fun of it. My major videogame releases can be found on my [Itch.io page](https://JunoNgx.itch.io/).

    I have been making videogames since 2013, under the moniker Aureoline Tetrahedron. The *manafarm* rebranding was made in 2019, after several years of hiatus. I have tried many languages, engines, tools, and everything in between, for all sort of devices and platforms, and still counting.

    Growing up with a Nintendo Famicom, I have always been a videogame enthusiast, and videogame is my medium of choice for creative expression. I have been led to many interesting ideas and knowledge introduced by games alone. 
    
    It's fair to say that my career in software engineering was kickstarted by love and curiosity for videogames.
